## Description: 

ProtFeat is designed to extract the protein features by employing POSSUM and iFeature python-based tools.

POSSUM (Position-Specific Scoring matrix-based feature generator for machine learning),
a versatile toolkit with an online web server that can generate 21 types of PSSM-based feature descriptors,
thereby addressing a crucial need for bioinformaticians and computational biologists.

 iFeature, a versatile Python-based toolkit for generating various numerical feature representation schemes for
 both protein and peptide sequences. iFeature is capable of calculating and extracting a comprehensive spectrum
 of 18 major sequence encoding schemes that encompass 53 different types of feature descriptors.

## Installation

ProtFeat is a python package for feature extracting from protein sequences written in Python 3.9. ProtFeat was developed and tested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Please make sure that you have **Anaconda** installed on  your computer and  run the below commands to install requirements. Dependencies are available in requirements.txt file.

```
conda create -n protFeat_env python=3.9
conda activate protFeat_env
```
## Preparation to run ProtFeat

* Clone the Git Repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/gozsari/ProtFeat
```
* In terminal or command line navigate into **protFeat** folder.
```
cd protFeat
```
* Install the requirements by the running the following command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to run ProtFeat to extract the protein features 

* Then run the following commands in the following order:
```
cd src
python

import protFeat
from protFeat.feature_extracter import extract_protein_feature, usage
usage()
extract_protein_feature(protein_feature, place_protein_id, input_folder, fasta_file_name)
```
## Explanation of Parameters
Here, we explain about
**protein_feature: {string}, (default = 'aac_pssm'):** one of the 21 PSMM-based protein descriptors in POSSUM.

* **POSSUM descriptors:** aac_pssm, d_fpssm, smoothed_pssm, ab_pssm, pssm_composition, rpm_pssm,
s_fpssm, dpc_pssm, k_separated_bigrams_pssm, eedp, tpc, edp, rpssm,
pse_pssm, dp_pssm, pssm_ac, pssm_cc, aadp_pssm, aatp, medp , or all_POSSUM

  * all_POSSUM: it extracts the features of all (21) POSSUM protein descriptors
<br/>

or one of the 18 protein descriptors in iFeature.

* **iFeature descriptors:** AAC, PAAC, APAAC, DPC, GAAC, CKSAAP, CKSAAGP, GDPC, Moran, Geary,
NMBroto, CTDC, CTDD, CTDT, CTriad, KSCTriad, SOCNumber, QSOrder, or all_iFeature

  * all_iFeature: it extracts the features of all (18) iFeature protein descriptors
<br/>

**place_protein_id: {int}, (default = 1):** It indicates the place of protein id in fasta header.
e.g. fasta header: >sp|O27002|....|....|...., seperate the header wrt. '|' then >sp is
in the zeroth position, protein id in the first(1) position.

**input_folder: {string}, (default = 'input_folder'}:** it is the path to the folder that contains the fasta file.

**fasta_file_name: {string}, (default ='sample'):** it is the name of the fasta file exclude the '.fasta' extension.


## Input file 

* It must be in fasta format

## Output file

* The extracted feature files will be located under
**feature_extraction_output** 
folder with the name: **fasta_file_name_protein_feature.txt** (e.g. sample_AAC.txt)
* The content of the output files: 
  * The output file is *tab-seperated*.
  * Each row corresponds to the extracted features of the protein sequence
  * The first column of each row is protein id (in UniProtKB), 
      the rest is extracted features of the protein sequence.
